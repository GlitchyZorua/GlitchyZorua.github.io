    <p>(Not to be confused with the RGBeat Clock)</p>
    
    <p>This 24-hour clock right here changes colors depending on what time it is, in hex (#RRGGBB), in this case, the hours are red, the minutes are green, and the seconds are blue. (in this case, it would be #HHMMSS). Yes, the colors are really dark!</p>
    
    <h2>What is the reference?</h2>

    <p>If you played the game, "Hacknet", before, you would know that there is a hexclock program! Which, as you expect, changes the color of the ui based on what time it is! This is where I first learned about what hexclock is, when i first played the game, and I thought it was pretty neat!!</p>
    <p>I won't get into detail on how you obtain this ""app"", (because this isn't the whole point of this topic, you do have to go out and find it)</p>
