    <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>

    <p>This site is not intended for mobile users. but it might work.</p>
    <p>This also not intended for old browsers. Such as WebTV boxes. For some unknown reason the site crashes the boxes. I'm working on fixing it dont worry. I will create a different site where itll be lightweight for old browsers. Firefox is highly recommended.</p>
    <p>There is alot of javascript on this page. NONE of them should sell your personal information. (they are purely just decorational!)</p>
    <br>
    <b>A no-javascript version of this website will be coming soon!</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>This site does have some edgy humor here and there, but they aren't too over the top.</p>
    <br>
    <p>and yeah, it does have profanity. but its not overused.</p>
